# HTML

## Starting template
The code below is a good starting point when creating an HTML file.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">            
        <title>Page Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Page heading</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Common HTML Tags
Common tags that are good to begin with:

### Document structure
- Comments `<!--..-->`
- Doctype `<!DOCTYPE>`
- Html `<html>`
- Head `<head>`
- Title `<title>`
- Link `<link>`
- Body `<body>`

### Type of content
- Header `<header>`
- Footer `<footer>`
- Division/Section `<div>` or `<section>`
- Main `<main>`
- Aside `<aside>`

These are just to tell the browser about your content. It won't affect the page layout in any way.

### Content
- Division/sections `<div>`
- Hyperlink `<a>`
- Headings `<h1>`,`<h2>`,`<h3>`,`<h4>`,`<h5>`,`<h6>`
- Paragraph (normal text) `<p>`
- Image `<img>`
- Unordered list `<ul>` and ordered list `<ol>`

### Forms

- Button `<button>`
- Input `<input>` (many different type such as text, checkbox, file, number etc)
